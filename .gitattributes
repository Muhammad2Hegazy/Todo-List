# .gitattributes

# Mark specific JavaScript files or directories as 'vendored'
# This tells GitHub's Linguist to ignore them for language statistics.

# Example: If you have a 'dist' folder with compiled JavaScript files
dist/** linguist-vendored

# Example: If you have a 'build' folder with compiled JavaScript files
build/** linguist-vendored

# Example: If you have a specific legacy JavaScript file you don't want counted
src/legacy-javascript-module.js linguist-vendored

# If you have JavaScript files that are test fixtures and you want to exclude them
# tests/fixtures/**/*.js linguist-vendored

# You generally DO NOT need to add .ts or .tsx files here unless GitHub is severely
# misidentifying them (which is highly unlikely for standard TypeScript files).
# For instance, if for some reason GitHub thought your .ts files were a different language:
# *.ts linguist-language=TypeScript
# *.tsx linguist-language=TypeScript

# Other common .gitattributes settings (unrelated to language detection, but often useful)
# Normalize line endings to LF (Linux/macOS style) for all text files
* text=auto eol=lf
